# Mute_Checker
This is an obspython script to help a user remember to unmute their microphone by notiftying them (With a Tkinter GUI Message) if their microphone remains muted for longer than a configured length of time.

## User Options to Edit
For the moment, configuration is done by editing the script itself. All of the configurable variables are at the top of the script.
